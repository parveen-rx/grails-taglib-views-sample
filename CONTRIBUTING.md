## Code of Conduct

## What should I know before I get started?

Please read Groovy and Grails coding standard and design pattern from official docs before starting actual code.

## How Can I Contribute?
Please create a branch with following convention:
* Prefix can be bug/SA-, feature/SA-, task/SA- etc. (or relevant name)  

## Reporting Bugs

GitHub issue reporting shall be used to report all the issue, feature improvements, new feature requirements, tech debts, tasks etc.

## Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the code quality
- Add relevant message in each commit with prefix as issueNumber: commit message
- Fix problems that are important and critical to application
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible sample application
- Enable a sustainable system for sample application's maintainers to review contributions
- Raise the pull request and add relevant reviewer for code review. Assign the code pull request to active contributors major changes.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
